First lenght value sets the horizaontal offsets of the shadow, or how far from the left or right the shadow should fall. We set that value for 5 px. Seconds value sets the vertical offset of the shadow. It sets how far from the top or bottom the shadow should fall. We set that value for 8px. The third value is an optional value we can use to set the blur radius, or the amount of blur applied to the text-shadow. We set that value to 0 so that we're able to see the shadow offsets more clearly.The fourth value is the color value, the text shadow color value can  be any of the keyword, hexadecimal, or RGBA values. Remember, if we don't set a text shadow color, it will inherit the text default color value. So we set that color value to shade of black by setting a hexadecimal valur to #222. if we set the blur value to 10px notice how it softens our text-shadow with a nice blur. So the heigher the blur radius value, the blurrier the shadow gets, because the shadow becomes wider and sort of lighter. The first to offset values can also be negative numbers. Now. what that does is it offset the shadow in the opposite direction. For instance, lets change horizontal offset to -5px and vertical offset to -8px. Notice that the shadow is offset to the left by -5px and offset up -8px. We now changed their value to enhance. (black, black, black, .8 or 80%) .8 is the value of alpha. */

Here we define a linear gradient background. In between the parentheses is where we'll need to define the colors of the gradient. The colors can any of the keyword values, it can also be a hex value or an RGBA color value. The value on top will create a fade from the orange to firebrick red, from top to bottom. Now, once we have our gradient colors defined, we're also able to control the angle and position of our gradients. Please note that we have two color stops here, the orange colors and the firebrick color stop. Now we added a third colors stops which is dodgerblue.*/
  
  
  /*Please note for color stops: by default, since we haven't defined any color stop position values just yet, we're telling the browser that the orange color stop needs to begin at zero position. Then display a continuous color transition down to the firebrick color stops, which begins halfway at the 50% position.The continue that smooth color transition down to the dodgerblue color stop, which ends the gradient at the 100% position. 0% position means starts from color edges and ends at 100% position for the last color stos. So as we can see, at each color stop position declared the respective color value's hue is 100% of its color. The browser then evenly distribute and fades the other values.*/
  
  
  /*Note: we need to delete the second background image declaratio in our main header rule, so the one containing the radial-gradient. What we're going to do is add the new gradient values to the existing background property here in our main-header rule. So a realy useful feature in CSS3 is that we're able to layer multiple background images. All we have to do is seperate each background value with a comma, just like we did earlier with text shadows. When defining multiple background values, it's important to remember that the first value listed will be the top layer rendered. And the last one will be at the very bottom, so in our design we'll want the mountains background image, as the bottom layer,*/
  
  
  /*Please note for color stops value: if you go back and change any of these color stop position values, the gradient adjust according to those values. For example, if you change the second firebrick color stop position to 20%. You can see that pure firebrick red color at 20% in the gradient instead of 50%. Then it's evenly distributed and faded into the dodgerblue color stop. If you go back and change the color stop position value into something else let's say from 20% to 60%. Notice how that pure firebrick red hue now starts at the 60% position in the gradient line. And we can even go beyond the 100% value to get wider color transitions. For example, let's change the third color stop to 120%. We can see that the color transition from red to dodgerblue is now much wider. So now we're only seeing the top part of the color transition to dodgerblue.*/
  
  /*By default, the gradient direction goes from top to bottom, If we want to reverse the gradient order so that the firebrick red color starts from the top, well we can either reverse the colors in between the parentheses or we can add the direction value to top before the color values.*/
  
/*  background-image:linear-gradient(to top, #ffa949, firebrick); This will reverse the color of the linear-gradient above.*/
  
/*  background-image:linear-gradient(to left, #ffa949, firebrick); This will change the direction of the gradient starts on the left side and ends on the right side of the header.*/

/*  background-image:linear-gradient(0deg, #ffa949, firebrick); Notice how this creates a gradient starting from the bottom to the top. It's the same as the top value we used earlier. */
  
  
  /* So, as the angle direction increases, it then continues rotating clockwise unless we define a negative value. For instance, if we change the angle value from zero degrees to 45 degrees */

  
/*  background-image:linear-gradient(45deg, #ffa949, firebrick); Notice how the gradient moves 45 degrees clockwise. So now it starts at the bottom left corner and ends at the top right corner.*/

The first value in a box-shadow sets the horizontal offset of the box-shadow. And like text-shadow, apositive value moves the shadow to the right, and a negative value will move the shadow to the left. rgba "a" means the alpha. So just like text-shadow, if the box-shadow color is not defined, the color rule will render the shadow according to the element's color property. As you can see it's offset by 15px to the right and 15px towards the bottom. We added a blur value of 10px to sort of soften it up our box shadow. And there now seems to be a little more depth between the div and the background of the page. and notice how the box-shadow has no affect on the layout of surrounding elements. It doesnt push elements down or up. That's because box-shadow, like text-shadows have no influence on layout. The fourt length value in a box-shadow property is called the spread value, because it moves or spreads the shadow away from an element. And it does it equally in all directions. So it gives us a little more control over the size of the box shadow.So if we want to spread our box shadow by 20 pixels in every direction, while maintaining the 20 pixels blur radius, let’s set the value to 20px. Notice how it spreads the shadow by 20 pixels on every side of the div. We changed the x offset to 0, and let's pump the radius up to 20px and change this spread value to -12px. This will sort of squeezes in the box-shadow, and we get this subtle floating box effect at the bottom of the wildlife div. Changed: add inset as first value, changed horizotal offset to 20px, changed vertical offset to 20px, removed the spread value-12px the forth value. Changed blur value to 5px. pumped alpha up to 1. by default, box-shadows are created as drop-shadows outside of an element. But if we want to create an inner shadow, we can do that with a box shadow by adding the keyword value, inset.

The inset value must be declared either first or last, in our box-shadow value. Otherwise, the line will be ignored. By setting the vertical and horizontal offset to 0 and use the blurand spread radius values to adjust the shadow. Let's changed the blur to 50. and lets widen it by 10px so spread distance by 10px. By give a inset value this will set the shadow inside evenly for all four sides of the div.which gives us a nice shadow effect.*/
  
  
  /*So first let's apply the rounded corners to each individual corner of our wildlife div. Because we're also able to specify custom border-radius values for each corner of an element. The border-radius property is actually the shorthand property for four seperates values. Here we are adding border-radius property for each corner of our div. The border values we assigned can be any length units, or a percentage.*/
  
  /* So first we are going to set our border-radius with pixel units.*/

  border-top-left-radius: 50px;

  /*Shorthand version of border-radius property*/
  
/*  border-radius: 50px 10px; The order values in the border-radius shorthand property also follows that same clockwise order used for the padding and margin shorthand values. So the first value applies to the top left corner, which values is 50px, the next one applies to the top right corner. which is 10px, the third value applies to the bottom right border, which is 50px, and finally, the fourth value is applied to the bottom left border is 10px. Or you can just leave it 50px and 10px nothing will change. We only need the 10px for this project for now*/
  
  border-radius: 10px; /*We only need this for now.*/
  
  
  /*If we want to set an even value border-radius for each side of our div, we'll simply need to define one value. Example: */

/*
border-radius: 100% 25px; if we change the border top left and border bottom right values to 100%, notice how the rounded corner takes up 100% of the left and bottom right corners of our div. So as we can see border-radius with percentages can create some interesting shapes. 
*/
  
  
/* border-radius: 50%; Because of percentage value this will make our div shapes like a oval

/* Media Queries-------------------- */


/*A media query is simply a style block containing one or various conditions. And, if those conditions are true, the media query takes effect. If they false, the browser or device ignores them.*/

/*@media  (max-width: 960px) {   The @media rule is what specifies the media type we want to target. There are few recognized media types we can use so that we're able to create CSS and serve it specifically to any of those media types. For example, the All media type targets all devices. There's also a media type for Print, Green, even one for Speech. So we want our media queries to affect all devices and computer screens, so, we'll want to go with All media type. Please note: All is the default media type for media queries. So we can actually omit it from our media statement if we want to. So remember, if you don't define a media type, the All type will be implied. We no longer needed it. You can coment this out for reference only.*/

/*So now, we'll need to write an expression inside the parenthesis that will check for those true or false conditions I mentioned. First we need to define the media feature we are testing for. Some of the media features we can use are width, height. We can also check for things like max-width, max-height, also a device's orientation and a few other features.*/ 

/*So we are going to use the max-width media feature to check for the max-width of the browser's viewport. Then, we're going to follow that with a colon and define a pixel based value of 960 pixels. We can also make this a percentage value, an em's value or any linked unit. Keep in mind, that we don't need to include a semi colon after the value. inside parentheses. Otherwise, the entire media query is ignored. So make sure to keep those semi-colons out of the media feature expressions.*/

/*So this expression will query the max-width of the display area, which in our case is the browser's viewport.  */

So right when the view port hits that 960px width, the colors change and they remain that way as the browser gets narrower. But once we're at anything wider than 961 pixels, they change back to their original colors.*/

/*The view port width is still less than 960px. Unless we override it with a new property, like we did above with background, the text color will remain white. But if we want to define certain styles only at a certain range of viewport sizes, we'll what's great about media queries is that 'we're able to add or combine expressions if we need to get more specific about a device or a viewport range. */

/* Media Queries-------------------- */


/*Note: The last thing we need to do in our Lake Tahoe website is add a couple of media query breakpoints to adjust our layout for smaller devices and viewport sizes. Currently parts of our layout are breaking at certain points. So we have to delete or comment out the first media queries we created above */


/*We start seeing a lot of issues in our layout. When you resize the browser the contents starts to get narrow and cramped. And it gets to a point where the content is barely readable. So as you can see in some areas the text in columns are too narrow, or the line height and font sizes are too big, and we're seeing that appear in the header area. So we can adjust this with media queries.*/

/*First thing we want to do is create a new media query that checks when the device or browser viewport is 1024px or lower.*/

@media (max-width: 1024px) {  /*This time we used max-width media feature and we set the value to 1024 px*/


  .primary-content,       /*Now let's target the primary and secondary content divs and them a little wider at 1024px.Because currently the 75% width seems a little too narrow.*/
  .secondary-content {
  
   width:90%;

}


/*so if you scroll down to our wildlife container and resize the browser, notice how there appears to be a little too much padding applied to the div. Here we are going to adjust the padding for our wildlife class div.*/

.wildlife {   /*Let's target the class wildlife */
  
  padding: 10% 12%; /*Apply padding property. 10% for top and bottom and 12% for left and right padding.*/
  
  margin: 50px 0 20px; /*Let's adjust the margin property. 50px for top, 0px for left and right, and 20px for bottom margin.*/
  
  
  /*Summary: Notice when you resize the browser, down to about 768px or lower, you can see that it looks a lot better. The content and the div no longer looks too narrow or cramped and thew new margin values closed up some of that extra space around the div.*/

  
}


/*Summary: Once you resize the viewport at 1024px or narrower, the primary secondary content divs expand to 90% of the browser width.*/

}

/*So now we want to expand the content even further when the viewport is at about 768px. And we'll want to adjust other areas, like the main header's text and it's height, and we'll also want to fix this issue down here in our column. width. Now, let's create one more media query.*/


@media (max-width:768px) {   /*Here once again we are going to use the max width media feature. But this time, we're going to aply these new styles when the device or browser's viewport is at 768 pixels or narrower.*/


/*So what we'll do is copy this primary secondary content rule from our first media query and I'm just going to paste it down here in our new media query.*/


  .primary-content,
  .secondary-content {
    width:100%; /*We just changed the width value from 90% to 100%*/
    padding: 20px; /*Let's also add a padding property and let's give the value of 20px*/
    border-top: none; /*We also want to remove this top borders in the primary, secondary content divs by adding a border property and set the value to none.I made some changes here. I added back the top border line because I kinda like that. I added a -top instead of just border.Here you will a grey border on top of the footer.*/
  
  /*Summary: So by adding a border-top: none gives it a little separation between the content and the footer.*/
}

/*Summary: So now when we resize the browser down to 768px or lower, the main content areas are no longer too narrow for optimal readability. And now those top borders are now gone.*/

/*Next let's adjust our header height, because currently the 850 pixel height seems a little too tall for maller screens.*/


/*Let's target our main header with the main header class.*/


  .main-header {
    max-height: 380px;
    padding: 50px 25px 0;  /*Let's also adjust the padding, because currently the top padding of 170px is a little too much. Top padding is 50px the left and right paddings is 25px and the bottom padding is 0*/

}


/*Let's also target the title element with the title class.*/

  .title {
    font-size: 1.3 rem; /*We're going to take the font size down to 1.3 rem*/
    border: none;

}

/*Next, let's target the h1 heading with the h1 selector and let's take the font size down to 5rem*/

  h1 {

  font-size: 5rem;
  line-height: 1.1; /*let's also change the line height. Let's make it smaller by changing it to 1.1*/
}

/*And now that the header will be much shorter, let's also hide this arrow image in our main header. To do that we need to target the class arrow*/


  .arrow {

  display: none; /* To hide the arrow we need to set the display value to none. Please note that the arrow will only disappear if you resize the screen to smaller.*/
}


/*The next thing we need to do is adjust this intro paragraph's text size.back to the root font size of 16px. Because currently, the text seems a little too big for smaller screens. So to adjust our text size we are going back to our second query and target the intro class.*/
  .intro {

    font-size: 1rem; /* To set the font size back to that root font size of 16px, remember, we can use the rem unit so let's set the value back to 1rem.*/
}



/*Next we need to make some adjustment to our column layout. Notice how their a little too narrow and cramped in this narrow viewport. So let's go back to our second media query and we're going to target the resorts and tips columns.*/

  .resorts,
  .tips {

    float: none;  /*Instead of floating the two columns in the narrow viewports, or smaller screens, we're going to remove the floats by adding a float property and set the value to none.*/
    width:100%;
}






/*Let's also reduce some of the top and bottom padding here in our footer. So let's go back to the second media query and target the main footer class.*/


  .main-footer {
  
  padding: 20px 0; /*Top and bottom paddig is 20px, and the left and right padding to 0px*/
  
  
  /*So now the footer doesn't seem too tall and out of place on the smaller screens and viewport sizes.*/
