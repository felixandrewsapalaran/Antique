        <p> Antique (pronounced an-TEE-keh) is an unassuming Western Visayas province that's just waiting to be discovered. If you're searching for quite shores, then Antique is for you. Charter a boat from Culasi to take you to hook-shaped Malalison Island. It's sparkling waters hug a powdery white-sand shore. Snorkel in Batabat Coral Reef, and you'll see a bunch of fish and aquatic animals. A local favorite is Malumpati Cold Spring, whose waters flow into the Bugang River. Get a cottage near the pool. This place is ideal for swimming and picnics.</p>
